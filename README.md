Mortal Kombat 3 Ultimate AI using TensorFlow, Keras, and Gym-Retro
==================================================================

This project is an implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm using TensorFlow, Keras, and Gym-Retro to train an AI to play Mortal Kombat 3 Ultimate. The goal is to create an AI agent that can learn to defeat human players.

Requirements
------------

*   Python 3.x
*   TensorFlow
*   Keras
*   Gym-Retro
*   Mortal Kombat 3 Ultimate ROM

Installation
------------

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  Download and install Gym-Retro by following the instructions in the [official documentation](https://retro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html).
4.  Download the Mortal Kombat 3 Ultimate ROM and place it in the `roms` folder.
5.  Run the training script with `python train.py`.

Usage
-----

To train the AI agent, run `python train.py`. This will start the training process and save the trained model to the `models` folder.

Once the model is trained, you can test it by running `python test.py`. This will load the trained model and start playing Mortal Kombat 3 Ultimate using the trained AI agent.

Results
-------

The goal of this project is to create an AI agent that can learn to defeat human players in Mortal Kombat 3 Ultimate. The results of the training process may vary depending on the chosen hyperparameters, but the aim is to create an AI agent that can perform at a level comparable to that of an experienced human player.
